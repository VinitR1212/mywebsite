              <h3>Introducing RAVO</h3>
              <p><strong>Introducing RAVO</strong> is a 10-second motion graphics animation I created for my dadâ€™s
                videography brand. I designed the logo in Adobe Illustrator and brought it to life using After Effects,
                aiming for a clean, mechanical-style animation. All sound effects were sourced from Pixabay, and the
                final result is a compact and polished intro built to enhance his video presence.</p>

              <h3>Text Morph Animation Test</h3>
              <p><strong>Text Morph Animation Test</strong> is a After Effects experiment where I explored the
                use of keyframe graphs to create smooth, fluid animations. The piece begins with 3D blocks flying
                through space before morphing into a humorous text that reads "I eat dirt." I used keyframe animation to
                ensure smooth transitions, giving the piece a polished and dynamic feel.

              <h3>Walking Animation Test</h3>
              <p><strong>Walking Animation Test</strong> is a very short but impactful project I did to practice and
                improve in Blender. This taught me how to model, rig, compose, and animate which helped me understand
                the basics of 3d animation. This project was also used later to be portfolio content in my application
                to the IMD program.</p>

              <h3>Branduci Troll Edit</h3>
              <p><strong>Branduci Troll Edit</strong> is a professional edited video. The song is composed by upcoming
                artist <i>Branduci</i> and showcases the artists pure talent visually on the big screen, This was made
                on capcut and a lot of hours were put into this project. I am very grateful to be editing for such a big
                artist it is my dream come true.</p>

              <h3>Music Video Project</h3>
              <p><strong>Music Video Project</strong> is a very fun project I made with <i>Branduci</i> where I got to
                make a full on music video with one of his hit singles. This was edited in Premiere Pro with certain
                elements taken into After Effects for high quality compositions.</p>

              <h3>The Button Animation</h3>
              <p><strong>The Button Animation</strong> is a animation made on After Effects made for fun. All auditory credits are in the Youtube description. I also made all the sprites and had a lot of fun making this as it gave me a better understanding of parenting elements in After Effects.</p>
